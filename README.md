# SMRubik

Rubik's Cube solver and visualiser. Supports camera as input.

The cube viewer is made in Processing. Allows any movement of the cube through keyboard inputs. It also allows to scramble and solve it. It is initially based on ["Coding Challenge #142"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PGfL4t-uqE) by "The Coding Train" on Youtube.

The scanning code is implemented in Python using OpenCV. The solver code is Python too.

**Version 2**: The cube can be scanned at any position on the screen. Uses shape detection to locate the pieces. For more details check [this other repository](https://github.com/empb/Rubik-OpenCV).
